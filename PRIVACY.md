## User data
Turbine uses Firebase Authentication to create user accounts. Other than your authentication details, Turbine stores recently viewed spots, user-created lists, check-ins and condition reports. This data only stored as a means of surfacing features such as a list of recently viewed items and is only ever collected as a result of clear, user-initiated actions.

## iKitesurf
Turbine is powered by real-time data from iKitesurf. This data requires an iKitesurf Pro account to ensure iKitesurf's data ownership and monitization is respected. To verify and authenticate data requests from iKitesurf, Turbine asks you to login to your iKitesurf account so an iKitesurf session token can be generated. This session token is used by Turbine for data requests, like forecast's and graphs, to tell iKitesurf that the requestee is an authenticated Pro user. This token can be revoked from Turbine at any time through the Settings page or by logging in and out of iKitesurf on the web or other mobile apps. Turbine does not see your iKitesurf password or any other sensitive data associated with your iKitesurf account.
