# Privacy Policy

Turbine uses Firebase Authentication to create user accounts. Other than your authentication details, Turbine stores recently viewed spots, user-created lists, check-ins and condition reports. This data only stored as a means of surfacing features such as a list of recently viewed items and is only ever collected as a result of clear, user-initiated actions.

Turbine allows you to connect your iKitesurf account by supplying your authentication token from iKitesurf. This is stored with your user object and can either be revoked anytime within the Turbine app or by signing out of your iKitesurf account anywhere online (invalidating the token). This is used as a way to respect iKitesurf's pro-only paywall and is never used other than to retrieve and display iKitesurf pro features to paying iKitesurf pro members.
